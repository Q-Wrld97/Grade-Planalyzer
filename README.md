## Executive Summary
As students, we all know from personal experience that there are always moments
toward the end of any given semester in which we all inevitably whip out our calculators to
perform a series of “doomsday” GPA number crunchings. Questions arise such as “What do I
need to score on this final to pass the course?” or, hopefully, “What’s the absolute worst I can
do and still retain my ‘A’?” Such questions are important in prioritizing one’s time and
establishing goals, especially when coinciding project and exam deadlines roll in for those
already juggling multiple courses and responsibilities from family to work! “But where are the
answers to all these pressing issues?” you might ask. Why, the how, the what, the when, and
the where are all within the Grade PlanAlyzer, of course – it just needs you!
The Grade PlanAlyzer application is our solution to students’ woes by creating a
platform tailored to providing them a more robust, proactive, and quantitative approach to
academic planning throughout each semester. By retaining all of one’s pertinent academic
information, the student not only avoids having to manually transcribe large quantities of data
on a case-by-case basis to calculate grading hypotheticals, but is also afforded the luxury of
attaining more dynamic and impactful results via the application of data analytics. In other
words, the student will remain keenly aware of one’s academic standing throughout the
entirety of a given semester such that they may make informed decisions to guide their path
forward, rather than defensively access such information to backpedal a semester gone awry.
The Grade PlanAlyzer will enable students to optimize their time management skills and
dedicate a more appropriate amount of time to each assigned task. This approach will enable
them to ensure that they are allocating their efforts efficiently and effectively, ultimately
resulting in better overall performance and academic outcomes.
