             As students, we all know from personal experience that there are always moments
             toward the end of any given semester in which we inevitably whip out our calculators to
             perform a series of “doomsday” GPA number crunchings. Questions arise such as “What do I
             need to score on this final to pass the course?” or, hopefully, “What’s the absolute worst I can
             do and still retain my ‘A’?” Such questions are important in prioritizing one’s time and
             establishing goals, especially when coinciding project and exam deadlines roll in for those
             already juggling multiple courses and responsibilities from family to work! “But where are the
             answers to all these pressing issues?” you might ask. Why, the how, the what, the when, and
             the where are all within the Grade PlanAlyzer, of course – it just needs you!
